# ia/log

This is my Nth attempt to start some kind of blog sharing very rarely some of pieces of technical information.  
This repo is a mixture of configs, assets and magic files which, I hope,
will make blog looks nice, smooth & fast without any animation/ads/poppups/cookie banners nor any other insanity which seems to be mandatory for modern web.
